Thank you for the meeting! Here are the details for you first Rails
project. The deadline is January 6th.

You can read about Rails from the book attached and also please take a
look at the online materials:

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

The task is as follows (a lot of things are unclear for now but they
should be OK after you start with the book):

--write a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) application which will
work as "Recipe Book" kind of app, storing & reading the data from a
PostgreSQL database.
--models: Recipe, Author, Ingredient
--Recipe attributes: Recipe Name (String), Difficulty (a list of Easy,
Intermediate, Pro, Chef - constants, required), Author (class,
optional), Comment (String, text area-optional)
--Author attributes: First Name, Last Name, Email Address (write a
validation for the email format) - all strings, only First name is
required
--1:N relation between Author and Recipe (one author can have multiple
recipes), one Recipe can have only one author
--Ingredient attributes: Name (string), Amount (decimal), Unit (a list
of Gram, Milliliters, and Piece - all constants)
--1:N relation between Recipe and Ingredient (one recipe can have
multiple ingredients). Even if it would be better to have M:N here, we
will do it simple now and implement this with 1:N.
--Recipe and Authors could be Created, Read, Updated and Deleted. If
you delete an Author, his Recipes are nullified (not deleted). If you
delete a Recipe, the Author will be kept. If you delete Recipe,
Ingredients associated will be deleted.
--try to implement AJAX for these CRUD operations (at least, for
Create and Update).
--you can use jQuery with Rails
--use Bootstrap (Google it) for CSS to make it nice
--the app should be responsive in browsers and on cell phones
--IMPORTANT: write tests for the app!
--the code should be put to a GIT repository (github.com), read more
about git at https://git-scm.com/
--push your code & results on a daily basis to the git repo you
created at github.com
--add me as a contributor in your new repo. My GitHub account is
jirihradil. This way, I can track your progress and give you comments
if necessary.
--versions: use the latest stable Rails & PostgreSQL database.
